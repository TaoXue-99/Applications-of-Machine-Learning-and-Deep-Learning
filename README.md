Applications! Applications! Applications of Machine Learning and Deep Learning

I learned a lot about "algorithms" during my study of machine learning and deep learning. I also read a lot of books to learn the details of these "algorithms". But... But it seems I've never realized the true meaning of them. Why? I don't know. One day, I asked myself a question, what can machine learning algorithms actually do? So here's a demonstration of how machine learning and deep learning are applied in the real world? And what problems they can solve.
